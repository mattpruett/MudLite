# MudLite
A very simple MUD written in C# to act as a showcase of my development skills.
 
Normally, I would perfer MS SQL as my database solution as I am more familiar with it and it's implementation of T-SQL. However, SQlite is far more portable. Part of this project will be familiarizing myself with Sqlite3.

For the moment, this project is not complete. There is much to do.
- User profiles
- Character creation
- MOB behaviors
- Room traversal
- Combat
- Scripting engine (Optional)

# Tech Stack and tools
C#, Visual Studio, Sqlite, Entity Framework, .NET Framework 4.7.2
